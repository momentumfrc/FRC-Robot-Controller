# FRC Robot Emulator

Implements the FRC robot-to-driverstation communication protocol.
Allows for using non-roborio robot controllers (such as the VMX-pi) with the FRC driverstation.

## Compatibility
The protocol implemented is based off the 2016 protocol found in [LibDS](https://github.com/FRC-Utilities/LibDS). It works with [QDriverStation](https://github.com/FRC-Utilities/QDriverStation), but has not been tested with the official FRC driver station.
